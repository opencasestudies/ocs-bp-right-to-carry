### Title

Examination of Multicollinearity Influence on Inference Using
Right-to-Carry Gun Law and Violent Crime Data

### Motivation

The influence of the implementation of less restrictive right-to-carry
gun laws on violent crime is a historically controversial topic. One
reason for the contriversy, is concern that some earlier reports examing
this topic may have used methods that were inappropriate.

One of the major concerns is that an earlier report included multiple
demographic variables that were collinear with one another. This
resulted in different a very coefficient estimate for right-to-carry gun
law adoption than other reports that did not include colinear varaibles.
This phenomenon is called
[multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity),
and it can result in abberant findings for particular explanatory
variables, despite not altering the overall predictive power of a model.

In this case study we use data peform simplified analyses similar to
those of reports on this topic to explore the influence of
multicolinearity on coeffcient estimate stability. We however, do not
recreate the previous analyses. The reports that we use as a guide for
our analysis are:

1.  John J. Donohue et al., Right‐to‐Carry Laws and Violent Crime: A
    Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State‐Level
    Synthetic Control Analysis. *Journal of Empirical Legal Studies*,
    16,2 (2019).

2.  David B. Mustard & John Lott. Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry
    Concealed Handguns. *Coase-Sandor Institute for Law & Economics*
    Working Paper No. 41, (1996).

### Motivating question

1.  How does the inclusion of different numbers of age groups influence
    the results of an analysis of right to carry laws and violence
    rates?

### Data

In this case study, we perform analyses similar to those in
<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf" target="_blank">Donohue, et al.</a>
article and the
<a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&amp;context=law_and_economics" target="_blank">Lott and Mustard</a>
article, however **we do not try to recreate them**, instead we perform
simplified analyses to allow us to focus on multicolinearity.

Therefore we use a subset of the **explanatory variables** used by each
article including:

1.  Data about state demographics in terms of population compositions
    for age, sex, race, as well as overall population values from the US
    Census Bureau:

Six demographic variables are created for the
<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf" target="_blank">Donohue, et al.</a>-like
analysis and 36 were created for the
<a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&amp;context=law_and_economics" target="_blank">Lott and Mustard</a>-like
analysis.

To use this data, we also need [Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) state
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code){target="\_blank",
to identify what demographic data corresponds to what state. This is
also available from the
<a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2014/demo/popest/2014-geocodes-state.html" target="_blank">US Census Bureau</a>.

1.  Police staffing data, which was downloaded from the
    <a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs" target="_blank">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>

2.  Unemployment data, which was downloaded from the
    <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/dsrv?la" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.

3.  Poverty data, extracted from Table 21 from this
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html" target="_blank">US Census Bureau Poverty Data</a>

4.  Right-to-carry law data, which is available in a table in the
    <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf" target="_blank">Donohue paper</a>

Finally our outcome of interest is violent crime rates. The violent
crime data was downloaded from the
<a href="https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm" target="_blank">FBI uniform crime reporting system</a>

#### Learning Objectives

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by
the end of this case study are:

<u>**Statistical Learning Objectives:**</u>

1.  what multicollinearity is and how it can influence linear regression
    coefficients  
2.  how to look for the presence of multicollinarity and determine the
    severity
3.  the difference between multicollinearity and correlation

<u>**Data science Learning Objectives:**</u>

1.  data import of many different file types with special cases
    (`readr`, `readxl`, `pdftools`)
2.  joining data from multiple sources (`dplyr`)  
3.  working with character strings (`stringr`)
4.  data comparisons (`dplyr` and `janitor`)
5.  reshaping data into different formats (`tidyr`)  
6.  visualizations (`ggplot2`)
7.  perform iterative simulations (`rsample`)

#### Data import

In this case study particularly covers many different types of data
import. We cover data import using the Tidyverse `readr` package to
import the various types of text files, the Tidyverse `readxl` package
to import excel files, and the Tidyverse `pdftools` package to import a
PDF file. We demonstrate special cases where header rows need to be
skipped, or colum data types need to be specified. We also use the the
`list.files()` base function together with the `map()` function of the
Tidyverse `purrr` package to efficiently perform data importation of
multiple files with one command.

#### Data wrangling

This case study is covers many details about wrangling data from excel
files with unusual header structures and with similar data in multiple
tables within the same file. This involves using the `stringr` package
to split, subset, detect, extract, and modify patterns of text. This
also involves using the `tidyr` package to change data shape and using
the `dplyr` package to summarise, select, filter, modify, and join data.
They case study also covers using various `map_*()` functions of the
`purrr` package to perform functions across tibbles within lists and the
`across()` function of the `dplyr` package to perform functions across
columns of an individual tibble. This case study provides especially
diverse material about data wrangling.

#### Data Visualization

This case study demonstrates how to make correaltion plots and scatter
plots with error bars. We also show how to add labels and arrows to
plots.

### Analysis

This case study covers balanced panel regression model data analysis
with fixed effects. In doing so we provide an introduction to
longitudinal analysis in general, as well as use of the `plm` package.
We also show how to calculate [Variance inflation factor
(VIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor) values
using the `car` package to quantify the severity of multicollinearity.
As another assesment of multicollinearity, we demonstrate how to perform
simulations to evaluate the stability of coefficient estimates.
